## 2026-05-03 — TICKET-006

**Surface:** Gemini CLI
**Model:** Gemini 2.0 Pro
**Duration:** ~30 min
**Branch:** ticket-006-valuation-service
**PR:** _pending_
**Status at session end:** IN_REVIEW

### What got done
- Implemented `LivePosition` and `PortfolioSummary` domain models in `app/domain/positions.py`.
- Created `app/services/CLAUDE.md` defining service layer principles (statelessness, dependency injection).
- Implemented `valuation.py` service with `compute_live_positions`, `compute_portfolio_summary`, and `clear_caches`.
- Implemented per-ticker failure isolation in `compute_live_positions`.
- Created exhaustive unit tests in `tests/unit/services/test_valuation.py` using fakes and mocks.
- Verified all quality checks (ruff, mypy, import-linter) and 104 passing tests.

### Files touched
- `app/domain/positions.py` — updated
- `app/domain/__init__.py` — updated
- `app/services/CLAUDE.md` — new

### Tests
94 passing → 104 passing (10 new)

### Decisions made during the session
- Used explicit `Literal` type hint for `staleness` to satisfy `mypy`.
- Favored `compute_live_positions` for generating test data instead of manual `LivePosition` instantiation to avoid consistency check issues.

### Out-of-scope items noticed
- (none)

## 2026-05-03 14:30 — TICKET-007
